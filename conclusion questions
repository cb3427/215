Convert the following code segments as instructed.
Write one if statement:
if (value > 0):
    if (value < 10):
        print("did it")

If (value > 0) and if (value < 10):
    print(“did it”)

Write multiple if statements:
if ((len(my_str) > 0) and (my_str!= "password")):
  print("did it")

if ((len(my_str) > 0) and 
    if (my_str!= "password")):
    print("did it")

Write multiple if statements (watch out, this may be trickier than it looks):
if ((len(my_str) == 0) or (my_str!= "password")):
  print("did it")

if ((len(my_str) == 0):
    print(“did it”)
if (my_str!= "password")):
  print("did it")

Consider the following debugging techniques and describe how each one is most useful. List the pros and cons of each technique. 

Comments - You can know what your code does and find things easier.
Print statements - Allows you to see if values are being assigned wrong, or if they’re working.
Hand tracing - Actually looking at your code again can help you find simple mistakes/errors.
Test cases vs. user-defined input - Make sure all your inputs will  match up and are being used correctly.
Debuggers - Breakpoints in code allow you to jump to certain parts of the code and see how your code is working.
